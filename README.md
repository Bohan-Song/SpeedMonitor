I am so intersted about network that I configue network monitor tool on all the platform I used including Win10 and android.

But I find there don't exists a free tool on mac.

As a Programmar I find this [repo](https://github.com/Congee/NetSpeedMonitor) from github.

As the original author is no more maintence it since `Mar 24, 2016`

`istat Menu` is good but it is not free.
Besides it is a little heavy for me.
